I've been so accustomed to using html and css with an accompanying javascript to add some animation or make how interactive websites could look. And then , i usually to use convert method psd to html on creating website .  
And I myself have also been a few times great handling and make the web their own responsive to other media, and maybe I'll show you a few websites I answer I created with responsiveness to mobile and tablet.   
Responsive designs both mobile, tablet or laptop computer even I apply every my website creation. And don't forget to always apply some script javascript to make a webiste interactive looks interesting and I did.
