Hi there!

Thanks for downloading this Upwork Cover letter template. We hope you find it useful .

Just a few things we wanted to point out before you start.
   - The sections in bold will need to be personalised by you as relevant to the jobs you apply for. 
   - You can (and you should) personalise your proposals as much as possible. 
   - So as long as you retain the basic elements, feel free to be creative with your proposals.
   - Keep your cover letters short, succinct but packed with information about you and how you can help the client achieve their goals. 
   
Under this , you will find an example of a proposal, using this template. This will show you exactly how to put the template to use in real life.
